# SortedMultiMap_DSA
ADT SortedMultiMap â€“ represented using a Singly Linked List Array (SLLA) with unique keys, and sorted using a relation on the keys. For each key, an SLLA of values is stored.

This project implements a Sorted MultiMap data structure in C++, which stores unique keys and multiple associated values for each key using a Singly Linked List Array (SLLA). The keys are sorted using a comparison relation. For each key, an array of singly linked lists (SLLA) is used to store the values. The project includes both short and extended tests, as well as an iterator for traversing the elements.

Files in the Project
  - App.cpp: The main application file that demonstrates the usage of the SortedMultiMap and tests its functionality.
  - ExtendedTest.cpp: Contains extended test cases to verify the correctness and performance of the SortedMultiMap data structure.
  - ExtendedTest.h: Header file for the extended test cases, defining test functions for larger and edge cases.
  - ShortTest.cpp: Contains short test cases to check basic functionality and correctness of the SortedMultiMap.
  - ShortTest.h: Header file for the short test cases, declaring functions to test basic operations on the SortedMultiMap.
  - SortedMultiMap.cpp: The implementation of the SortedMultiMap class, which uses a SLLA to store keys and multiple values.
  - SortedMultiMap.h: Header file for the SortedMultiMap class, providing declarations for its methods and attributes.
  - SMMIterator.cpp: Contains the implementation of the iterator for the SortedMultiMap, which allows traversing over the elements of the map.
  - SMMIterator.h: Header file for the SortedMultiMapIterator class, defining the interface for iterating through the elements of the SortedMultiMap.

NOTE: The code for this project can be found on the master branch.
